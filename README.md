## Tools used to create Frisbee Fodder
I'm writing and article on how I went about building a responsive web comic framework and making something that allowed me to focus on creating and drawing the comics rather than tweaking text and css positions for every episode. Below is a list of tools that I have used to help me on the way.

* Jekyll
* Sass
* Foundation (Grid)
* Adobe Illustrator
* svgo
